# Gesture Recognition
> Problem Statement
 Imagine you are working as a data scientist at a home electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions.
 You want to develop a cool feature in the smart-TV that can recognise five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote.
 
 The gestures are continuously monitored by the webcam mounted on the TV. Each gesture corresponds to a specific command:
 Thumbs up:  Increase the volume
 Thumbs down: Decrease the volume
 Left swipe: 'Jump' backwards 10 seconds
 Right swipe: 'Jump' forward 10 seconds
 Stop: Pause the movie
 
 |Gesture|Response|
 |-------|--------|
 |Thumbs up| Volume up|
 |Thumbs down| Volume down|
 |Left swipe| backward - 10 secs|
 |Right swipe| forward - 10 secs|
 |Stop| Pause|
 
 Each video is a sequence of 30 frames.
 
 
 
## Goal
> To develop a deep learning model that is capable of classifying different gestures.
 
 
## Dataset
> The dataset for this model can be retreieved from the [link](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1ehyrYBQ5rbQQe6yL4XbLWe3FMvuVUGiL). The training dataset consists of hundreds of videos with their ground truths noted.
